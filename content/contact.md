### Community

Please join our [Computational Humanities Research
forum](https://discourse.computational-humanities-research.org/)! The forum serves as an
asynchronous platform to discuss all ideas and questions related to computational
humanities research. These can be in-depth discussions about fundamental topics and
questions of the discipline, or very practical ones, for example about how best to tackle
a certain technical (coding) problem. And everything in between. Come join!

### Contact
For questions, ideas, or support, contact the
[organizers](mailto:info@computational-humanities-research.org) or drop us a line on the
[forum](https://discourse.computational-humanities-research.org).
