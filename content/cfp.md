In the arts and humanities, the use of computational, statistical, and mathematical approaches has considerably increased in recent years. This research is characterized by the use of formal methods and the construction of explicit, computational models. This includes quantitative, statistical approaches, but also more generally computational methods for processing and analyzing data, as well as theoretical reflections on these approaches. Despite the undeniable growth of this research area, many scholars still struggle to find suitable research-oriented venues to present and publish computational work that does not lose sight of traditional modes of inquiry in the arts and humanities. This is the scholarly niche that the CHR conference aims to fill. More precisely, the conference aims at


1. Building a community of scholars working on humanities research questions
   relying on a wide range of computational and quantitative approaches to
   humanities data in all its forms. We consider this community to be
   complementary to the digital humanities landscape.
   
2. Promoting good practices through sharing “research stories”. Such good
   practices may include, for instance, the publication of code and data in
   order to support transparency and replication of studies; pre-registering
   research design to present theoretical justification, hypotheses, and
   proposed statistical analysis; or a redesign of the reviewing process for
   interdisciplinary studies that rely on computational approaches to answer
   questions relevant to the humanities.

### Topics of interest

We invite original research papers from a wide range of topics, including -- but
not limited to -- the following:

- Applications of statistical methods and machine learning to process, enrich and analyse humanities data, including new media and cultural heritage data; 
- Hypothesis-driven humanities research, simulations and generative models;
- Development of new quantitative and empirical methods for humanities research;
- Modeling bias, uncertainty, and conflicting interpretation in the humanities;
- Evaluation methods, evaluation data sets  and development of standards;
- Formal, statistical or quantitative  evaluation of categorization / periodization;
- Theoretical frameworks and epistemology for quantitative methods and computational humanities approaches;
- Translation and transfer of methods from other disciplines, approaches to bridge humanistic and statistical interpretations;
- Visualisation, dissemination (incl. Open science) and teaching in computational humanities.
- Potential and challenges of AI applications to humanities research.

To gain further insight into paper topics, please also refer to the proceedings of previous years: [CHR2020](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2723/), [CHR2021](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2989/), [CHR2022](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3290/).

### Venue
The 2023 edition of the Computational Humanities Research conference will be hosted by the [École pour l’informatique et les techniques avancées (EPITA) - Paris](https://www.epita.fr/en/homepage/). The conference will be a hybrid event with an option to attend in person, virtually, or a combination of the two. More details will follow soon.

### Submission types

**Long Papers**: up to **5000** words (ca. 10 pages, references, abstract and
   tables/illustrations excluded). Long papers report on completed, original and
   unpublished results. Brevity of argument is preferred. We welcome the use of
   appendices or other supplementary information.

**Short Papers**: up to **3000** words (ca. 6 pages references, abstract and
   tables/illustrations excluded). Short papers report on focused
   contributions, and may present work in progress.

**Lightning Talks**: Submit a 750 words abstract to give a 5 minute presentation during a lightning talks session. This format can be well suited for reporting work in progress, introducing ideas, preliminary results, or focused question-answer research.
   
**Posters**: For poster presentations we ask you to submit an abstract describing your work in about **750** words (references excluded). Posters are well suited to present new or early stage research, for a corpus or database description, or for detailed technical explanations and clarifications. 

Posters and lightning talks abstracts will not be published in the proceedings, but they will be added to the website of CHR.


### Submission instructions and review process

Submissions should be written in English and must be formatted according to the
[CHR latex
template](https://github.com/cohure/CHR2023-website/raw/main/data/chr2023_latex_template.zip)
(see instructions on the forum to get you started
[here](https://discourse.computational-humanities-research.org/t/chr-latex-instructions/230)).

Submissions are to be submitted anonymously. All submissions will be refereed through
a double-blind peer review process by at least three reviewers with final
acceptance decisions made by the Programme Chairs.

Papers and posters should be submitted as PDF documents via the Easychair
conference management system: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=chr2023.

At least one author of each accepted submission must register to the conference and
present the paper or poster.

Accepted papers will be submitted for publication online via the
[CEUR-WS](http://ceur-ws.org/) Proceedings publication service.

### Instructions for paper anonymisation 

Any information which might help identify authors should be anonymized. To this
end, please:

1. do not include authors' names and affiliations;
2. use placeholders for code and data repositories, e.g.
   https://anonymous.4open.science/, https://zenodo.org/record/xxxxx;
3. do not mention self-references in a way that can reveal the author's
   identity, e.g. do not use "We previously demonstrated (Smith, 2002)" but
   "Smith (2022) previously demonstrated";
4. leave acknowledgements blank.

### Anonymity period

The anonymity period runs until the notification of acceptance (**September,
2023**). Preprints can be published after this date. No deanonymized preprint should be published prior to submission as well, as CHR has no anonimity period cutoff.
